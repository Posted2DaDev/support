A rule of thumb for our products is to ALWAYS download it from our official Discord Server.

:::

### <font color="#C21807">Downloading the Product</font>

After purchasing CafePOS Lite, head over to the respective channel and download the files named "CafePOSLITE.rbxm" and "PRPLCode-PUBLIC.rbxm,". Put CafePOSLITE.rbxm in the workspace, and PRPLCode-PUBLIC.rbxm in ServerStorage.

### <font color="#C21807">Preparing the Game</font>

For products to work, the games owner must be in the prplSolutions group, unless they're affiliated with us.

HTTP requests must be enabled. (Enable it in Home -> Game Settings -> Security -> Allow HTTP Requests, then press Save.)

### <font color="#C21807">Moving Folders</font>

You will need to move a few folders into their respective positions.

Move "Move To StarterPlayerScripts" to StarterPlayer -> StarterPlayerScripts
Move "Move To Workspace" to workspace.
