# Breach of Terms

:::info

Breaching our Terms of Service may result in licences being revoked, or being blacklisted from games with our products.

:::

All products contain a "blacklist" system, preventing people, or groups, who were blacklisted by prplSolutions from joining games with our products in it. This cannot be disabled.
If a user/group poses a threat to our operations, blacklists will be issued, though this cannot occur as a result of external drama.
We reserve the right to remove licences, or blacklist users and groups at our discretion, with or without reason.
